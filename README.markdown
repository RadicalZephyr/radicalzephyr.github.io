# Zephyrizing is built with Octopress!

## What is Octopress?

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at
its finest.

1. **Octopress sports a clean responsive theme** written in semantic
   HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile
   devices.
2. **Code blogging is easy and beautiful.** Embed code (with
   [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) styling) in your
   posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
3. **Third party integration is simple** with built-in support for
   Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and
   Google Analytics.
4. **It's easy to use.** A collection of rake tasks simplifies
   development and makes deploying a cinch.
5. **Ships with great plug-ins** some original and others from the
   Jekyll community &mdash; tested and improved.

**Note**: Octopress requires a minimum Ruby version of `1.9.3-p0`.
