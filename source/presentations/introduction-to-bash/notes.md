Things! Stuff! Words!

Articulate a "floor" of what experience is required for this talk.
Particularly with concrete examples of what they should be able to do
(like you must have forked and merged with git)

- Think about motivating use cases


Okay, interesting things to think about. What is the base-level of
experience required for participation in this talk? That raises the
question of what kind of talk I want to give.

I think, assuming basic familiarity with how to open a shell, how to
use it for basic tasks like moving, copying, creating, renaming files
etc. Same for folders, moving around the filesystem and seeing what is
where. This is the base level.

Bonus if they've dealt with globbing, variables, loops etc. But not
necessary.

Interesting thing that Sumana made me think about.  I'm not sure how
much I want to/can go into the history of bash and where it came
from. That's sort of a rabbit hole and not really my personal
experience. But I think the organizational structure might suit
me. Talking about the unix philosophy, is really talking about how
bash "thinks" about the world. Same with argument processing and
finding programs.  Then, the end of the talk transitions into the more
experiential viewpoint of bash. How do you do the stuff, how do you
end up with what you want.

General ways to approach explaining things
- An historical perspective
- An org structure view
- Experiential view


Motivating examples:
Good example for find etc. with ebooks and deeply nested folder


- The Use/Mention distinction

So, what kinds of use cases can I dream up for motivating bash stuff?
Or can I find?
