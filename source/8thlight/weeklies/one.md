I basically worked on four things the past week/iteration. I wrote two
blog posts, one on the process of learning to do TDD and one about the
importance of using good tools. I also read the "4 Rules of Simple
Design" as well as the first chapters of the Agile PPP book up to and
including all five chapters on the SOLID principles. Finally, I
started writing an object-oriented TicTacToe game in Ruby while
rigorously practicing test driven development.

In the process of working on my TTT game and getting a handle on Ruby
and doing TDD I ended up doing quite a few other things. I ran through
the first three tests of the Bowling kata as described on Uncle Bob's
website, except that I used Ruby and RSpec instead of Java and
jUnit. I also did a bit of pairing with Zach also using Ruby and RSpec
working on an OO-TDD implementation of Turtle Racing. We didn't get
super far in the implementation, but it was a really enlightening
session and helped me solidify some of the concepts of TDD and feel
confident in starting to apply them in Ruby.

As a bonus, I also started reading the POODR book and got through the
first few chapters of Martin Fowler's "Refactoring".

I also got all of the administrative details of getting hired out of
the way (I think!).
