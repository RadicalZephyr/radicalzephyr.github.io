stuff and things. what do I want to write about? first off, I can
describe the three learning environments and their relative
differences. then maybe get deeper into how much structure they
provide?  Or describe structure as I introduce each.

I really don't have anything to say about 8th light's structure?

THe thought I was having is that it fundamentally has different goals
than either of the other structures. the university in fact has a
structure that supports it's goals quite admirably. The question is
whether those goals are what you are trying to achieve.

this is underscored by garrett's situation. I have the freedom to
pursue all of these different opportunities for learning because I
have the financial resources to do so, and I in some ways because I
finished my CS degree. There is a degree of freedom in knowing that I
could get a good paying job on the basis of my skills and my CS
degree.


garrett possesses neither of these advantages.
