One really hard thing about trying to write responses to portions of
ZatAoMM is that it's a whole book, and all of the concepts slowly and
gradually build on each other. It's really difficult to extract just a
part of it without feeling the need to explain large swaths of it in
an imperfect and reductive summarization.

But without the context of the book, it's hard to say something
meaninful about in response to it.  It's even harder to try and relate
the book to something else. Because then there are several things to
explicate, and then conclusions to draw and the amount of writing just
keeps increasing.

Maybe what I'm really saying is that it's hard to write something
small in response. It almost demands a piece of writing that takes the
time to develop a full response to it. This is frustrating to me when
trying to write blog posts at the last minute because there's just not
enough time for me to do it.
