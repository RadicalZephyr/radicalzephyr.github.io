Where exactly am I going with this piece now? It needs to come back
around a bit, but I'm not totally clear how.

what are the other points I want to hit? I don't think the outline
that's in there right now is really what I want. It's a bit too whiny
and personal. It reflects more of my fear and doubt about learning
something new than a piece of writing that I want other people to
read.

RIGHT!! I wanted to touch on some examples of situations where the
other reasons were true. And I need to bring it back around to why and
when comfortable tools are important. The main example left is Phil
Nelson's stodginess regarding CVS. He knows the tool so well... That
should feed well into humility.

I think there are two main things that I want to hit before I tie it
up. I want to talk about the prospect of trying to learn Vim and
qwerty again. Or vim in qwerty rather. speficially for compatibility
reasons and

oh, and humility. Beginner's mind.  That's a key part of it. I also
somehow want to hit on the style of pairing that Lindsey and I did at
HS of bouncing code off of github and switching who was working on it.

Oooh, maybe that's where I go. talk about the difficulties of pairing
and the consequences that my learning Dvorak has had. conveniently
makes it hard for people to use my comp without assistance. Then speak
about how I solved that problem at Hacker School with git and both of
us using our own environment. Or the swarm coding solution developed
by Phil Hagelberg. (Not really a solution in the same way.)

Then talk about the purpose of my apprenticeship here at 8th
Light. About how I was struck by the "requirement" for journeyman
apprentices to "have the humility to begin again." The importance for
me of being humble and vulnerable.  Being willing to say "I don't
know" and to not be the most knowledgable person in the room or the
company. (that trait is two-edged for sure. It drives me to learn and
grow and get better, but it also is problematic in me seeking out
assistance. it definitely held me back at hacker school from getting
as much as I could have out of it.)

And then say that I'm going to try and approach Vim and qwerty again
with humility

Maybe finalize the thought with how this will give me a stronger
position to criticize Vim from.

# More thoughts

Stuff and things. About the struggle of liking emacs and things,
Dvorak being really hard.  Being excited about 8th Light,
etc. but having an issue reconciling the two. Curiosity about
learning Vim's interface.

Worried about how trying to learn another set of keybindings will
affect my mastery of emacs keybindings. Also worried about adding
more things to my already seemingly significant workload of
learning at 8th Light. Is it the best time to learn these new
tools, or the worst?

When is proficiency in a tool more important than other
considerations like compatibility with teammates, or using the
"best" tool.  This relates well to Phil Nelson's usage of CVS and
his entrenchedness in it. In many ways I feel the same about
emacs and git and the tools that I know. But I also think that
they're better.

Ultimately, I think that the answer most of the time is that the
tools you know best and are most comfortable with are the best
ones to use. Unless they are obviously inappropriate for the job.

Disliking the hostility of Vim user's towards emacs. I think
there's an important lesson in that about having awareness of
your own prejudices. Often we think of these things only in the
more "important" matters of race, gender, and sexuality
discrimination but prejudices are prejudices and if we're blind
to some of our own prejudices, the chances that we're blind to
others seems high. On the other hand, developing the habit of
watching and introspecting ourselves about our potential
prejudices seems like the way to avoiding being prejudiced in all
things. Sometimes it's easier to start with the relatively
inconsequential thing.

connect with Brett victor's preciousness and fragility of ideas.
Maybe, proficiency in a tool becomes more important when it
enables you to nurture and bring to fruition more and fragiler
ideas.  Or maybe when it simply enables ideas, and thinking more
deeply.

My experience of trying to code in vim, typing in QWERTY was
illustrative of this. I approached it differently in thinking,
and I had to devote so much mental energy to thinking about how
to type the code in, that there's no way that I could hold the
same amount of complexity in my head that I do when I'm coding in
emacs.

this may be a blessing and a curse. For trying to think in a new
paradigm, the way that I need to with TDD it might be
fundamentally easier to do when I'm not in the familiar
environment of Emacs and Dvorak. Mental ruts are definitely a
real phenomenon.


This is also all related to humility. Specifically, the humility of
being a beginner. But it's not just humility that you get out of being
a beginner, you also get the chance to be the one who doesn't
know. This is hard for me. Really hard. I've spent most of my life
avoiding situations where I didn't know things, and when I found
myself in them despite my efforts, I usually resort to not saying
anything as a way of hiding the fact that I don't know.

It was, in a lot of ways, a big thing for me to pair program with Zach
on his computer, using a QWERTY layout and vim as the editor. One of
the hardest parts about it though, was that it was unacknowledged that
this was hard. And that I have a belief, however valid or not, that
most vim users would not be willing to do the same thing.
