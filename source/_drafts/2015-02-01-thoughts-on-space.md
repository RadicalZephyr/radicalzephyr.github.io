This post is going to be something of a pity party, so if those bother
you feel free to skip it.

I've always known that I needed "my own space.' I always attributed
that to my general level of introversion. But recently it's becoming
clearer where some of that tendency comes from. I have really bad
allergies. As my doctor said to me after looking at my blood test
results "[I] was born to have allergies." When I was younger it was
primarily cats, dust mites and grass pollen that I was allergic
to. Oh, and rabbits.  Rabbits in a big way.

For about five years I got allergy shots. As I recall it, my allergist
at the time (who has the wonderful first name "Pandora") laid it out
like this. I would take allergy shots for about five years, starting
daily and then gradually over time spacing out to one every six
months. This would provide me with an increasing level of protection
from the things I was allergic to the longer I took the shots, and
then once I stopped at five years the protection would slowly fade
over the next five or so years.

I started this regimen when I was in middle school, probably 12 years
old. For a while it was a pain, but I adjusted to the schedule of
daily, then later multiple shots per week.  And my allergies improved.
I was still going to get a reaction if I went to visit a a friend who
owned a cat, but instead of starting to sneeze moments after I walked
in the door, I'd probably have to sit down on a cat-infused sofa. That
at least gave me time to dose myself with some antihistamine's which
would give me a few hours of normalcy.

In fact, my allergies got so much better that I stopped really
thinking about them. I no longer considered myself to be an "allergic
person." Then, around my second or third year at college, my allergies
started coming back in force.

There's a long story in there about how at the time I was living in a
group house that had a cat, and then I ended up leaving that house to
move in with my girlfriend Mirami who also had a cat. This may sound
crazy from someone who has self-described as "allergic to cats," but
like I said, I didn't really consider my allergies to be a critical
factor in my life. The next few years saw my allergies rather
thoroughly reassert themselves as a dominant factor in many of my
decisions.

When I moved in with Mirami and her cat, Jimmy Jazz, I ended up
getting allergies on a very regular basis. We quickly tried to
determine boundaries that would help stabilize things, but even
banning the cat from the bedroom and requiring Mirami to wash her
hands and face before coming to bed didn't prevent me from waking up
in the middle of the night most nights with a red, runny, itchy
nose. Needless to say it was a bit of a rough period.

The final kicker Pandora threw in was that by the time my ten years of
protection was up, "they" would hopefully have developed a more
effective treatment for allergies. Unlike the rest of her predictions,
that turns out not to have panned out quite as she hoped.

In retrospect I should have dealt with the allergies more
seriously. After not very thoroughly surveying the options available
to me at the time, I ended up finding (through my sister) a company
started by an English man who if anything had had worse allergies than
I did. He ended up intentionally infecting himself with human
hookworms, the gory details of which process I will spare you. If
you're interested look him up, his name is Jasper Lawrence and the
idea of intentially infecting yourself with various semi-benign
parasites is called "helminthic therapy."

This company, Auto-Immune Therapies had made a business out of
actually selling kits for infecting yourself with hookworms or
whipworms to aid in treating various auto-immune diseases.

Long story short, I ended up infecting myself with hookworms, and I've
had them for the last few years.

One of the things that I've found about having allergies: it's
incredibly important for me to be able to control at least one space
pretty much totally so I can keep it as close to allergen free as
possible. That way when all else fails - and it usually does - I can
always retreat back to my sanctuary to recover from an allergy attack.

This is difficult, but definitely doable, and over the years
out of necessity I have gotten pretty good at the aggregate of habits
and rituals needed to keep a space fit for my habitation.



Random anecdotes I could throw in:

- How much work one can get done when you only sleep for 3-4 hours a
  night. How histamines are a great stimulant
- In-depth description of what allergies feel like, from my
  rudimentary understanding of the actual processes. Especially WRT
  how it *feels* like an auto-immune disease.
- What having hookworms burrow into your arm feels like
- How "corporate" or public business places are awesome for me. Always
  very clean and rarely have pets allowed.
- How allergy attacks work in terms of ramp-up and ramp-down, and
  especially how that interacts with sleeping and getting allergies
  while asleep.
- The difficulty of how opaque what I'm allergic to is. Sometimes it's
  obvious, sometimes there's no clue. How random theorizing is
  necessary and also incredibly frustrating.
- The importance of learning to trust your nose when dealing with
  allergies and needing to be paranoid.



Where I'm going with this...
Allergies suck
Cathartic to write about it a bit
distracting

I don't know.  I had a point, about how my allergies have been driving
me to make a lot of decisions lately.
