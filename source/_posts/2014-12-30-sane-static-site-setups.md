During the last week of Hacker School I helped [Leta][] sort out
some issues she had with her blog setup and restore everything to
sanity. It was a lot of fun and the setup is pretty straightforward so
I thought I'd do a short write-up on what we did and why.

To be clear, this blog post is about solving the particular problem of
how to organize a statically generated site/blog. The particulars I'm
going to discuss are for when you host the site on [Github Pages][]
but you need to generate the site locally because you're not using
vanilla [Jekyll][] or not using Jekyll at all.
