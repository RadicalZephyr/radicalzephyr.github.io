So. I am a Fairhaven student. I'm also a Computer Science major. These
are two discrete descriptions of my academic life. Both are integral
parts of the story that I have been creating my whole life. But in
isolation, they imply very disparate things about me.

For most of my time at Western I have tried to keep these parts of
myself separate. Compartmentalized. This final year, and particularly
these last two quarters that has not been an option. Because of my
somewhat lackadaisical approach to planning my first few years my
schedule has been practically dictated to me. One of the consequences
of this has been having to intermix my main campus self, with my
Fairhaven self. This has been rewarding but difficult.

As a Fairhaven student, I _must_ take the Advanced Seminar during my
final quarter. And in the Advanced Seminar everyone writes what is
known as their _Summary and Evaluation_. I had heard of this document -
I've had quite a few friends graduate from Fairhaven while I knew
them - but I really knew nothing about it.

What I'm discovering is that it really is almost anything that we want
it to be. The loose sort of overall prompt is to tell whatever story
we want to about our life and education to this point. To help us on
begin that journey, we've been writing a series of short reflections
on a variety of suggested topics. But like so much at Fairhaven it
really is ultimately left to us to choose our direction.

I knew I had strong feelings about education.  Particularly about my
own. What I didn't quite realize was how much I had to say about both
my own education, and how it relates to Education in general. Perhaps
most surprising of all is that not only do I have a lot to say. I
actually have a story to tell. I still don't quite know the whole of
that story.  But bit by bit, I'm figuring it out. Excavating
it. You're welcome to tag along.
