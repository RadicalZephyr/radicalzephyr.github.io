title: My Life Process Notes

So, I'm noticing that when I have early morning classes (8 and 9 am
respectively), I don't get shit done in the afternoons. Night is an
inherently more productive time for me.

Actually, thinking back on it, even last quarter when I didn't have
early morning classes, I still had a really hard time getting anything
done from 2-5 or 6. Now the question is what should I do about it?

Maybe going to the gym during that time would help? Might just make me
more tired, but probably more likely to actually invigorate
me. Definitely make me want to go to sleep a bit earlier.
