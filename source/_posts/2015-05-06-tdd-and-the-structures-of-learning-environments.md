I've been fortunate this last year in getting to spend time in several
radically different learning environments in a relatively short span
of time. These experiences have gotten me thinking about the relative
pros and cons, also about how I respond to the amount of structure the
environment offers.

### The University

Okay, let's start off with the most structured of all, the
university. "formal education" is certainly the most structured of all
the environments I've been in recently. Apart from the lower-levels of
the same system, I'm having a hard time of thinking of a more
structured type of learning. I've written before quite extensively
about specific problems I have with the established school system, so
I'll just leave it at that. However, university courses are highly
structured. They are actually required to by the nature of the
system. Even Fairhaven College, a place which essentially strives for
less structure only achieves that, less structure.

An excellent symbol (and indeed, a representation) of that structure
is the course syllabus. Contained in that one document are supposed to
be all the expectations and requirements for "doing well" in the
class. I noticed something towards the end of my college career. These
documents started getting more formulaic. In fact, they seem to be
approaching the type of jargon-ified meanings as "lawyer-ese." For
instance, my university had a policy that no assignments could be
given to students during "dead week" - the week before finals -
*unless* the teacher had mentioned that it was possible in the
syllabus.

Because of this, many professors simply had a clause in their "stock"
syllabus that mentioned that there might be assignments due during
dead week, just to reserve the option. First of all, I have a problem
with a document that requires so much boilerplate that there can be a
"stock" version of it. Second, the system of rules and requirements
that caused teachers to always include a certain statement in the
syllabus regardless of their plans for the class, made the whole
system into a game, pitting students against each other, and often
also into opposition with their professors.

I resisted playing this game for a long time (most of my life
actually). After taking two years off from school when my mother fell
ill, I came back with a conviction that this game was a necessary evil
that I needed to play, and play well. So I did. I got excellent grades
in my last several quarters at Western in all of my classes, despite
taking heavy credit loads of all difficult classes. But I didn't learn
as much.

My normal method of doing school appears somewhat lackadaisical
compared to the studious diligence of many "good" students. But part
of the reason for this is that I tend to follow my interests, and go
well beyond what is being asked of me by the teacher. A classic
example was a paper I needed to write for a history class in high
school. I needed to do research on some historical topic, but on the
way I stumbled upon some fascinating information about dolphins. I
spent most of my evening reading and learning much about dolphins, and
not researching for the paper. My high school pre-Calculus teacher
summarized my attitude towards school by bestowing an award on me at
the end of the year: "Highest Learning to Grade ratio."
