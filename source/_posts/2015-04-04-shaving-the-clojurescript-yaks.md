About a week ago I got fed up with a [terrible website][mangafox] that
had comics on it I wanted to read.  So I decided to write a little web
app to make the reading experience more pleasant. Since I'm an avid
[Clojurian][clojure], I've been interested in checking out
[Clojurescript][cljs] for doing web development, and in particular
exploring the wonderful new world of React.js wrappers available in
Clojurescript. This is the story of how I learned to setup a
Clojurescript project.
