My understanding of the concept of personal power - or as I now call
it "gumption" - comes in large part from Robert Pirsig's _Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. In that book, there is a section where
he discusses the "gumption traps that [he has] known." There, he
describes many of his thoughts about the idea of gumption. The best
way to understand gumption would be to go read Pirsig's book. Failing
that, let me offer a few select passages.

I can't take the time to delve into what Pirsig means by Quality. For
that you really will have to read the book. But I love this passage
because it gets at the heart of Pirsig's - and my own - usage of
gumption without trying to rigorously define it. Another passage. Keep
in mind, I'm not trying to explain gumption, so much as give you a
feeling for it.

Gumption is a fascinating subject to me. It encompasses the idea of
motivation, but it also goes farther. When you enter into the idea of
gumption, you also enter a conversation about how to recognize and
sustain it in yourself. It provides a qualitative description for an
emotional/psychic phenomenon. Most importantly, thinking about the
concept of gumption and about gumption traps allowed me to start
thinking of how I can live in a way that avoids them. It also allowed
and encouraged me to start thinking about how I could build
gumption. As Robert Pirsig says: "Gumption is the psychic gasoline
that keeps the whole thing going."

Gumption is, at it's best, a mind-hack. I'm using hack here in the
sense that it is used by the website Lifehacker, which is in the
tradition of the great computer hacker's described by the programmer
and author Eric Scott Raymond. In essence, this means a clever trick;
an unexpected way of doing things that has greater Quality. By
leveraging the ideas of gumption I can hack my own mind to work in
ways that are more aligned with how I really want to be in the
world. This idea actually goes back to one of my favorite proverb's.

I first ran across this quote when I was probably 13. Young, and
highly impressionable, but this piece of wisdom has stuck with me and
shaped my life ever since then. Because of it, when I use the idea of
gumption to try and make myself more productive, I go about it in a
very particular way.

One of the most powerful gumption hacks that I have found is
cleaning. This is related to a conversation I had a long time ago with
one of my mother's friends. I was washing the dishes, and complaining
about it. He asked me "Why are you doing the dishes?" I was confused,
and told him I was doing the dishes because I had to. He responded,
clarifying:

"No, I mean are you doing the dishes so that the dishes will be done?
Or are you doing the dishes to do the dishes?"

This started a spirited and engaging conversation that did an
admirable job of distracting me from noticing that I was still washing
dishes. I'm not sure that I understood it at the time, but what he was
talking about was essentially mindfulness and presence.

By "doing the dishes so that the dishes will be done" I was mentally
residing in the future where the dishes were already done. This caused
me to have impatience. This produced a troubled state of mind. To put
it in the language of gumption, seeing washing dishes as a task to be
completed caused them to be a gumption sink.

Today though, I use dish-washing as a way to build gumption. When I'm
facing a large homework task, or an overwhelming project I go and I
wash dishes for a time. It's a sort of meditation for me, engaging my
body, inhabiting it in a mindful way. It strengthens my sense of
control over my life, and helps prepare me to start working on things
that are otherwise too hard to approach. As I've continued this
practice over the years I've found something interesting: my base
level of gumption has increased. Because of this, the difficulty of
tasks that I can approach unaided has increased dramatically.

A really remarkable example of this was my final quarter at Western. I
had a 17 credit schedule, the most intense load I had ever taken. On
top of that, three of the four classes I was enrolled in had large
projects with long due dates and the fourth had a large amount of
daily work. This combination of assignments has long been one of my
weak points; I don't plan long term well, and I also don't work well
under extreme pressure. The daily work always seems to be of greater
urgency because of the nearer deadlines.  But the large projects
always demand more time than I tend to predict. My desire to do
everything well then leads me to work frantically as soon as I realize
I don't have as much time as I need.  Then at a certain point I simply
can't work at all because the tension is too great. Looking back, it
is clear to me that I simply could not have handled that kind of
workload when I was a freshman in college. It's not clear that I could
have dealt with it even two years previously. However, my final
quarter went much better in many ways than my first quarter.

It took a long time for me to get to that point. Many other things
have contributed to my mindset. Conversations with fascinating people,
many excellent teachers. And of course, so many books.
