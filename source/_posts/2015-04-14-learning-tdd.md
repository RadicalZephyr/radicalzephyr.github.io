This is my second day at 8th Light and I've been working on writing an
object-oriented Tic Tac Toe program.  This would be no big deal for
typically, even though I'm doing it in a language I'm unfamiliar
with.

Except! I'm trying to very rigorously drive the development with
tests.

This is a fairly new experience for me. I mean, sure, when I first
read about TDD a while ago, I got really interested and excited about
it. I played with it a little bit, and tried to do some small stuff in
it. But I quickly got overwhelmed with the difficulty of "How do you
even get started?"

Yesterday, I made very minimal progress. I felt stuck not really sure
where to begin, and what to do. I ended up by basically writing tests
for a simple Board data class where I could make marks, and then see
that the marks were actually set. This felt highly unimpressive as the
output of my first day.


THings!! I wanted to make some comments about how doing the Kata's, I
noticed... What!!!!! SHit, what did I ontice? It was interesting, and
important and made me feel like I was "getting" TDD much better...

Other notes -- TDD is about a philosophy in a lot of ways. And the
importance of what I read about OOD isn't just some principles
etc. It's that the principles are all focused around an idea. That
idea is that software changes; the requirements for software
changes. They both need to do so frequently, and so one of the things
we should design for in our software architecture is change.
