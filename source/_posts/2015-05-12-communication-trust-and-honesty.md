A friend asked me an interesting question in an email the other
day. It wasn't especially succinctly put, so I'll try to paraphrase
the best I can. Basically, she was wondering what my take was on a
story she had from a friend of a friend regarding trust and honesty in
relationships.

> A friend of a friend of mine recently got into a big argument with
> her boyfriend because his ex girlfriend called in the middle of the
> night one night, and she asked who called and he said just his buddy
> at work, but then she checked his phone and it was his ex.  And it
> wasn't the fact that it was his ex that got her mad, it was the fact
> that he lied about it Why would he lie about it?
