Geoff Shannon has been an enthusiastic hardware hacker from a young
age; his first job was building automated production equipment with
[Provel Inc.][provel]. He has a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
and recently attended a batch at the [Recurse Center] in New York
City. In late 2013 he started working with Lego robots by exploring
the [leJOS][] project and using it to run a
[Clojure REPL on his EV3][ev3-nrepl]. He currently lives in Chicago,
IL working as a software apprentice for 8th Light.

To see what Geoff is currently working on and thinking about, check out
