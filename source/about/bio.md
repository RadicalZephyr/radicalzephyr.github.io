Geoff joined 8th Light shortly after attending a batch at the Recurse
Center and graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from
Western Washington University. He sees his apprenticeship as the
current step along his life-long path to mastering the art and beauty
of programming.

A recent transplant from the Pacific Northwest, Geoff is an
enthusiastic slack-liner and bike-rider, and is very appreciative of
the flatness of Chicago.
