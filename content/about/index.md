Heya, I'm Zefira! My [pronouns] are [she]/[they] (either set is
fine). I spend a lot of my time playing D&D, thinking about playing
D&D, modding video games, playing video games and dreaming about how
to revolutionize how we build software to make it more accessible and
flexible for everyone.

If you're interested in paying me to do that, or write other software
you can check out my [CV].
