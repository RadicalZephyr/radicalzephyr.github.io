## Employment {#employment}

### Software Crafter

    <li class="fa fa-building"> 8th Light Inc.</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Chicago, IL, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Oct 2015 -- Feb 2017</li>
</ul>

-   Ramped up quickly with a small team to rapidly deliver
    significant business logic changes and improvements on a legacy
    Ruby on Rails application.
-   Improved the testing infrastructure across a large
    service‐oriented architecture by introducing unit and integration
    testing patterns for the Clojure micro-services.
-   Built out external data service integrations for a large Clojure
    web app, building simple and elegant methods for interacting with
    legacy SOAP APIs and parsing XML documents.


### Software Development Apprentice

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> 8th Light Inc.</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Chicago, IL, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Apr 2015 -- Oct 2015</li>
</ul>

I spent the first few months of my apprenticeship improving my
discipline in basic practices like writing code test first and
creating clean, well‐factored code in both object-oriented and
functional style.

After the first few months I was put on a client project, working
to recreate in Ruby a PHP prototype for a web application. I worked
closely with a small team, and with the client. We delivered
valuable features on a weekly iteration schedule, giving accurate
estimates and presenting feature complete demos to the client every
iteration. While doing this, we used our deepening knowledge of the
client's domain to continuously improve the quality of the
code base.


### Software Developer

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> BRER Technical Inc.</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Bellingham, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Jul 2013 -- Jan 2014</li>
</ul>

As one of the most senior developers on the project, I was heavily
involved in designing the architecture of a custom system for
recording business information. The core purpose of the application
was to facilitate the creation of customer reports, a process which
could take up to six months when done by hand. With the new system,
the data would all be collected on site at the customer, and then
require only small additions to complete the report.

I personally reworked the report generating subsystem from creating
hand‐coded pdf's to using dynamic generation of LaTeX files to
produce professional looking final reports.


### Software Developer

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Provel Inc.</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Bellingham, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Aug 2012 -- Jul 2013</li>
</ul>

At Provel I was part of a distributed team including two other
software developers and several hardware and firmware experts.

I was responsible for investigating the feasibility of using data
gathered from an onboard MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope to help
determine changes in position and orientation of the device with
sub‐meter accuracy over periods of a few minutes.

Ultimately I determined that significantly more resources would be
needed to solve the problem to the accuracy required, and the
project moved in a different direction.


### Software Devolpment Intern

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Sage Bionetworks</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Seattle, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> May 2012 -- Dec 2012</li>
</ul>

I worked closely with a team of ten other developers, helping to
iterate on an existing multi‐tiered web service. Besides
contributing to the day‐to‐day bug‐fixing and code maintenance, I
spent the majority of my internship working on two projects that I
owned.

First, I completed an existing stub implementation of object
versioning in our system. This went from the database persistence
layer all the way through to a GWT user interface for the feature.

Second, I started an effort to introduce more comprehensive logging
into the core services, collating logs from across the entire cloud
deployment. The purpose of the logging was two‐fold: to help in
error diagnosis and recovery and to provide business information
about the usage of the system.


### Frontend Developer

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Hesselgrave Tours Ltd.</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Bellingham, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Oct 2011 -- Jul 2012</li>
</ul>

Migrated a 10,000+ lines ColdFusion web application to PHP in two
months using a hand-crafted pseudo-transpiler, starting from
knowing effectively nothing about PHP, and absolutely nothing about
ColdFusion.


### iOS Developer

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Western Washington University</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Bellingham, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Apr 2011 -- Sep 2011</li>
</ul>

I worked on a team with three other student employees, under the
supervision of a professor. One of my colleaguse and I were
personally responsible for maintaining and extending an existing
iOS study-aid app that displayed configurable virtual flashcards.

Because of the workload of the professor, I essentially took a
leadership role, helping to direct my fellow student's efforts. I
took the initiative to clean up much of the code. My main
contribution to the project was to fully revamp the animation
effects being used in the application to help highlight changes and
provide a good visual experience.

### Software Writer's Retreat

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Recurse Center</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> New York City, NY, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Oct 2014 -- Dec 2014</li>
</ul>

I attended the Fall 2 batch of the Recurse Center in 2014. While
there I:

-   taught myself OCaml and wrote a mini‐shell and mini‐VCS in it
-   learned about image processing, and implemented several classical
    algorithms for it in Clojure
-   implemented a simple postfix expression language in both Clojure and OCaml
-   improved on an existing hardware project for letting Recurse
    Center alumni into the space
-   paired with many other Recursers on their projects and generally
    had a really excellent experience


### B.Sc. in Computer Science

<ul class="cventry">
    <li class="fa fa-building"> Western Washington University</li>
    <li class="fa fa-map-marker"> Bellingham, WA, USA</li>
    <li class="fa fa-calendar"> Sep 2008 -- Jul 2014</li>
</ul>

I took the standard classes in data structures, algorithms, unix
development, networking, concurrency and databases. In addition, I
taught myself to use Git and brought it's use into every class, CS
and otherwise.

Languages used: Python, Ada, C, C++, Scheme/Racket, Erlang, Java,
Javascript, Objective-C, Clojure, Common Lisp, Emacslisp, Haskell,
R, NASM, Unicon, bash scripting, Windows batch scripting

Other interesting accomplishments:

-   Implemented many fundamental data structures and algorithms in
    Ada, gaining a deep understanding and appreciation for it's
    strong type system
-   Created a small working Unix shell in C developing a deep
    understanding of Unix programming and the capabilities of a shell
-   Implemented a simple remote file access protocol in C
-   Found a FOSS project to run a JVM on the pre-release Lego
    Mindstorms EV3 robotics kits and set it up, allowing the advanced
    robotics class to program their robots in a real programming
    language.
