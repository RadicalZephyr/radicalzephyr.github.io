<div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&rsquo;ve been an apprentice at 8th Light, I&rsquo;ve been focusing on
really trying to <em>get</em> TDD as a practice and a discipline. As part of
that I&rsquo;ve done a lot of reading and reflecting on past reading&rsquo;s about
TDD. One thing that jumped out at me about the way that Martin Fowler,
Kent Beck and Bob Martin all talk about TDD: the all tend to say
minorly self-deprecating things like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not smart enough to
hold all that complexity in my head.  TDD helps me get away with not
seeing the big picture.&rdquo; But I think this statement is fundamentally
misleading.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I was always a little confused when I read statements like that,
because to me the clarity of their writing and thoughts indicate to me
that they are in fact pretty smart. Another way they say it is that
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to be super smart to do TDD.&rdquo; This is I think a more
genuine statement, but it&rsquo;s much more about marketing than about TDD.</p>

<p>When I was writing Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby during the first month of my
apprenticeship though, I was trying to rigorously test-drive all of
the development in a very intentional way for the first time in my
coding career. As I got into the swing of things, I started noticing
that I was focusing on smaller portions of the code.</p>

<p>Normally when I&rsquo;m programming, I have something close to
<a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/">this experience</a>. I try and build up an understanding
and mental structure of as much of the program as I can hold in my
head at once. I do this largely because if I have the structure of the
whole program in my head then I know that when I make changes, they&rsquo;re
going to be good ones, and remain consistent with the rest of the
program.</p>

<p>One of the side-benefits of TDD is that you end up with a
comprehensive test suite for your program as you build it. So instead
of having to build a huge mental model of the software as you are
programming, you can simply make a change and then run the test
suite. This will tell you, with far greater accuracy, whether the
change is consistent with the state of the actual program. There&rsquo;s no
layer of indirection through a potentially inconsistent mental model.</p>

<p>So, having tests allows you not to have a large mental model of the
program you&rsquo;re building. Another (desirable!) consequence of rigorous
test-driving is a well-factored design. If the objects in your system
have small, well-defined responsibilities and interact with other
objects in reasonable and well-defined ways the system is simpler.
When the system is simpler, you can get away with having only a local
view of the code when making changes.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, these are reasons why you can still program
without a comprehensive understanding of the codebase when practicing
TDD. But the revelation that I had, what caused me to say that Uncle
Bob and company are being misleading, is that I think TDD is actually
easier to do when you let go of trying to build a comprehensive mental
model of the code. This is more true the &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; you are.</p>

<p>I had a friend in college who was arguably a genius. Assignments that
the rest of our class would take a week to do, he would churn out in a
12-hour Mountain Dew-fueled frenzy of coding. He would intentionally
seek to make assignments more challenging - for example doing a simple
assembly language project, he developed an Object Oriented style of
assembly programming.</p>

<p>I ended up working with him on a number of projects though, and I
discovered something. If I had thought that I had a tendency to
overengineer solutions, my tendency was nothing compared to this
friend.</p>

<p>One summer we decided to create an AI to play the video game StarCraft
and enter it in a contest at the end of the summer.  When we were
planning the architecture of the AI , he immediately started
describing this incredibly elaborate structure, with pluggable modules
that would allow swapping out of different components of the AI, and a
tiered architecture of decision making that would separate the low
level movements of units from the tactical and strategic
decision-making required to win the game.</p>

<p>This structure was impressive and compelling in a certain way, and we
spent weeks talking about it and sketching diagrams and class
hierarchies on the whiteboard. But after a month or so, interest in
the project sort of fizzled out and most people drifted away. Nothing
was ever built of that grand architecture.</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, most of the best programmers that I know have
this tendency to over-engineer solutions. From what I&rsquo;ve read, this is
not an isolated phenomenon in my social circle.</p>

<p>This type of pure thought design work is actually very similar to
building a mental model of how a piece of software works. It&rsquo;s really
just a change in tense: over-engineering is just building a mental
model of how a piece of software <em>will</em> work, in the future. There is
probably some fascinating psychology of why this is such a common
tendency, and an easy trap to fall into. My contention is that the
smaller your mental model of a piece of software is, the more
restricted your focus, the easier it is to refrain from attempting to
over-engineer it.</p>
