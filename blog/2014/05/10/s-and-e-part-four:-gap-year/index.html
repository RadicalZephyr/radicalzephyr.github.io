<div class="entry-content"><p>So I followed through and took one year off from school. A &ldquo;Gap Year&rdquo;
as it is somewhat euphemistically referred to. I spent some time
working for a cousin in Portland doing construction. After that I
helped my dad move a boat from Puerto Vallarta to San Diego. When I
returned from that, I was hired by a family friend, David Firth, as a
shop hand for his small business.</p>

<p>That was about six months into my Vacation.  Shortly after I started
working for him, I had to start thinking about whether I was going to
return to school the following fall. It was immediately clear to me
that I was still not ready to go back, so one year turned into two.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I ended up working for David Firth for most of the balance of my
Vacation. I learned a fantastic amount there. David is an amazing man,
both incredibly intelligent and talented, and incredibly driven.</p>

<p>I learned many things during my time working with him. He directly
trained me in many tasks and skills; through my work I got the chance
to practice and develop others. I learned how to pressure seal and
test a vacuum tank, prepare and wire complex devices, turn metal on a
lathe, use a mill, hand-form sheet metal, arc-weld sheet metal, pour a
polyethylene mold, along with many other skills.</p>

<p>David also taught me to use &ldquo;gentle but appropriate force.&rdquo; When I
first started working for him, I had a tendency to apply all of my
strength to any given task. He taught me to pay attention to what I
was applying force to - whether it was tightening a bolt, or replacing
a light bulb - and to gauge whether or not I was over-stressing the
material. This was an invaluable help to me, at a time when I was
still becoming used to the full strength of my adult body.</p>

<p>David also taught me many things implicitly. Since I was his only
employee, I got to work very closely with him. My job was essentially
to build the machines that he spent his days designing. When I
encountered unexpected difficulties in production, I would ask David
how to resolve them. This occurred often at first as I was still
learning the process of building the machines. Later, the difficulties
were fewer but often more profound.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I encountered a difficulty in some assembly step, it
wasn&rsquo;t indicative of my lack of expertise. Sometimes it was the
process itself that was flawed. As David inspected every issue he
would analyze the problem out loud. He didn&rsquo;t do this for my benefit;
it was his process. But it gave me the chance to watch him at work. As
he was analyzing the issues, he compared them to his intentions in the
design phase; he triaged which problems were design flaws, and which
were caused by imprecision in the work done by outside
contractors. And he talked about the solutions.</p>

<p>It was during one of these reactive design sessions that I decided to
go back to school. I was so inspired by my exposure to his design
process, that I wanted to pursue a discipline that would allow me to
do that kind of work. I have always loved &ldquo;inventing&rdquo; things.  When I
was little, my mother had a box of mechanical, electrical and plumbing
junk that was my &ldquo;invention box.&rdquo; Really the process that I love is
designing things. I used to spend hours drawing pictures of devices
that I wanted to build. I&rsquo;ve continued to do this throughout my life,
up to and including while I was working for David. However, I rarely,
if ever actually ended up building any of my creations. Working with
David, I got a glimpse of what it would take to bring my ideas into
the world. It made me want to be able to do that.</p>

<p>I decided to return to college to pursue an engineering degree. In
retrospect, I&rsquo;m not sure why I decided on engineering. David&rsquo;s degree
was in Industrial Design. Perhaps I felt intimidated by the art
requirements. Regardless, because of my new rationale for college, I
started looking beyond St. John&rsquo;s to different schools with good
engineering programs. During this time, my mother urged me once again
to take a look at Western Washington University.</p>

<h2>Going Back?</h2>

<p>Mostly to humor my mother, I did some browsing around on the internet
about Western. Somehow, I stumbled across the Fairhaven College
website and was intrigued enough to stick around. I ended up finding a
list of colleges that had similar goals as Fairhaven. Seeing both
St. John&rsquo;s College and Colorado College - another college I was very
intrigued by - on the list, I was immediately sold. Once again, when
it came time to apply, I knew that Western, and specifically
Fairhaven, was the only school that I was interested in attending. I
applied only to Fairhaven, and visited the campus for the first time
on the day of my Fairhaven interview.</p>

<p>As I was preparing to go to Western during the last few months that I
worked for David Firth, I started to teach myself programming. That
was actually part of how I knew I was in a better space to go back to
school. I had rediscovered my love of learning, and was pursuing it in
my own free time for my own sake. I have wanted to learn to program
for a long time. It&rsquo;s very difficult at this point to pinpoint when
that desire first manifested itself, because for a long time it didn&rsquo;t
seem feasible. I didn&rsquo;t have much access to computers when I was
younger, and certainly no mentors to help me get started on that
path. So I just sort of admired computers from arm&rsquo;s length. When I
combined this long standing semi-obsession with the sense of
empowerment and increased interest in learning I got from taking time
off, it was inevitable that I would start programming; and I loved it.</p>

<p>I spent most of my first year at Western taking mainly Fairhaven
classes. Along with those, I took the entry level programming class
during winter quarter, and did quite well. During spring quarter, I
took my first engineering class. The difference between the two was
extreme. Despite some initial frustrations with the programming
language used in Computer Science 141, I thoroughly enjoyed the
class. Engineering Technology 110 was a very different story.</p>

<p>From a certain perspective, it might just have been happenstance. I
enjoyed the engineering class, but I had no preparation for it. At the
same time, I got the feeling that a significant number of the other
students already had a greater amount of knowledge and experience. In
the programming class though, I was clearly ahead of the curve. During
the weekly labs it was obvious that there were only a few other people
that knew as much about programming as I did. For this class I was
clearly over-prepared. These seemingly minor differences resulted in
massively different reactions from me. Solely on the basis of those
two classes I decided to pursue a computer science major instead of
engineering.</p>

<p>In another lifetime I can see myself getting more hands on experience
building things when I was little. Instead of spending all of my
energy on the initial design phase, I would have learned more about
how to actually build things. This would have prepared me better for
the engineering class, and I might have had an experience more
comparable to the programming class.  What I don&rsquo;t know is whether
that would have made a difference. As I said earlier, I spent quite a
lot of time building things with David.</p>

<p>In some respects, this story about how and why I became a CS major is
another &ldquo;single story&rdquo; that I tell myself about my life. But this
story isn&rsquo;t really serving a particular purpose; it&rsquo;s mostly because I
forget the other parts. In reality, I didn&rsquo;t first teach myself to
program while I was working for David Firth right before I started at
Western in 2008. It really started six years earlier, when I was 14.</p>
