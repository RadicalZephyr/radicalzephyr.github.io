<div class="entry-content"><p>My understanding of the concept of personal power - or as I now call
it &ldquo;gumption&rdquo; - comes in large part from Robert Pirsig&rsquo;s <em>Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>. In that book, there is a section where
he discusses the &ldquo;gumption traps that [he has] known.&rdquo; There, he
describes many of his thoughts about the idea of gumption. The best
way to understand gumption would be to go read Pirsig&rsquo;s book. Failing
that, let me offer a few select passages.</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I like the word &#8220;gumption&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s so homely and so forlorn and
out of style it looks as if it needs a friend and isn&rsquo;t likely to
reject anyone who comes along. It&rsquo;s an old Scottish word, once used
a lot by pioneers, but which, like &ldquo;kin,&rdquo; seems to have dropped out
of use. I like it also because it describes exactly what happens to
someone who connects with Quality. He gets filled with gumption.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t take the time to delve into what Pirsig means by Quality. For
that you really will have to read the book. But I love this passage
because it gets at the heart of Pirsig&rsquo;s - and my own - usage of
gumption without trying to rigorously define it. Another passage. Keep
in mind, I&rsquo;m not trying to explain gumption, so much as give you a
feeling for it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gumption-filling process occurs when one is quiet long enough
to see and hear and feel the real universe, not just one&rsquo;s own stale
opinions about it. But it&rsquo;s nothing exotic. That&rsquo;s why I like the
word.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Gumption is a fascinating subject to me. It encompasses the idea of
motivation, but it also goes farther. When you enter into the idea of
gumption, you also enter a conversation about how to recognize and
sustain it in yourself. It provides a qualitative description for an
emotional/psychic phenomenon. Most importantly, thinking about the
concept of gumption and about gumption traps allowed me to start
thinking of how I can live in a way that avoids them. It also allowed
and encouraged me to start thinking about how I could build
gumption. As Robert Pirsig says: &ldquo;Gumption is the psychic gasoline
that keeps the whole thing going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gumption is, at it&rsquo;s best, a mind-hack. I&rsquo;m using hack here in the
sense that it is used by the website Lifehacker, which is in the
tradition of the great computer hacker&rsquo;s described by the programmer
and author Eric Scott Raymond. In essence, this means a clever trick;
an unexpected way of doing things that has greater Quality. By
leveraging the ideas of gumption I can hack my own mind to work in
ways that are more aligned with how I really want to be in the
world. This idea actually goes back to one of my favorite proverb&rsquo;s.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you begin to understand what you are without trying to change
it, then what you are undergoes a transformation.&rdquo; &ndash;Jiddu Krishnamurti</p></blockquote>

<p>I first ran across this quote when I was probably 13. Young, and
highly impressionable, but this piece of wisdom has stuck with me and
shaped my life ever since then. Because of it, when I use the idea of
gumption to try and make myself more productive, I go about it in a
very particular way.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful gumption hacks that I have found is
cleaning. This is related to a conversation I had a long time ago with
one of my mother&rsquo;s friends. I was washing the dishes, and complaining
about it. He asked me &ldquo;Why are you doing the dishes?&rdquo; I was confused,
and told him I was doing the dishes because I had to. He responded,
clarifying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I mean are you doing the dishes so that the dishes will be done?
Or are you doing the dishes to do the dishes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This started a spirited and engaging conversation that did an
admirable job of distracting me from noticing that I was still washing
dishes. I&rsquo;m not sure that I understood it at the time, but what he was
talking about was essentially mindfulness and presence.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;doing the dishes so that the dishes will be done&rdquo; I was mentally
residing in the future where the dishes were already done. This caused
me to have impatience. This produced a troubled state of mind. To put
it in the language of gumption, seeing washing dishes as a task to be
completed caused them to be a gumption sink.</p>

<p>Today though, I use dish-washing as a way to build gumption. When I&rsquo;m
facing a large homework task, or an overwhelming project I go and I
wash dishes for a time. It&rsquo;s a sort of meditation for me, engaging my
body, inhabiting it in a mindful way. It strengthens my sense of
control over my life, and helps prepare me to start working on things
that are otherwise too hard to approach. As I&rsquo;ve continued this
practice over the years I&rsquo;ve found something interesting: my base
level of gumption has increased. Because of this, the difficulty of
tasks that I can approach unaided has increased dramatically.</p>

<p>A really remarkable example of this was my final quarter at Western. I
had a 17 credit schedule, the most intense load I had ever taken. On
top of that, three of the four classes I was enrolled in had large
projects with long due dates and the fourth had a large amount of
daily work. This combination of assignments has long been one of my
weak points; I don&rsquo;t plan long term well, and I also don&rsquo;t work well
under extreme pressure. The daily work always seems to be of greater
urgency because of the nearer deadlines.  But the large projects
always demand more time than I tend to predict. My desire to do
everything well then leads me to work frantically as soon as I realize
I don&rsquo;t have as much time as I need.  Then at a certain point I simply
can&rsquo;t work at all because the tension is too great. Looking back, it
is clear to me that I simply could not have handled that kind of
workload when I was a freshman in college. It&rsquo;s not clear that I could
have dealt with it even two years previously. However, my final
quarter went much better in many ways than my first quarter.</p>

<p>It took a long time for me to get to that point. Many other things
have contributed to my mindset. Conversations with fascinating people,
many excellent teachers. And of course, so many books.</p>
