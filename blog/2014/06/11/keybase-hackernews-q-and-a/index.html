<div class="entry-content"><p>I started using <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> sometime back in April. I&rsquo;ve been interested
in doing crypto stuff for a long time, starting with using an SSH
keypair instead of a password to access the WWU CS department&rsquo;s
computer labs remotely.</p>

<p>Learning more about GPG and actually figuring out how to send and
receive encrypted messages has been on my list of things to learn for
a while, but every time I had a couple spare minutes and tried to
approach it I was rebuffed by the impenetrability of the manuals for
gpg.</p>

<p>However, recently while thinking about who to give my remaining five
invites to, I decided to do some more research on what those more
security-savvy than I thought about Keybase.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The results were somewhat of a mixed bag. In no particular order, I
read:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.lrdesign.com/2014/03/thoughts-on-keybase-io/">A thoughtful critique</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/03/19/Keybase">A nice first look</a></li>
<li><a href="https://filippo.io/on-keybase-dot-io-and-encrypted-private-key-sharing/">A response to the people decrying the upload private key feature</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.lizdenys.com/2014/03/31/refusing-to-verify-myself/">A brief look at the chain of trust in even getting Keybase</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I also came across the discussion that occurred on Hacker News shortly
after Keybase first appeared. As so often happens when I stumble on to
a HN comment page, I ended up reading the whole thing. What I noticed
was that there seems to be some information from Max and Chris (the
founders of Keybase) that I hadn&rsquo;t run across on the Keybase website
itself.</p>

<p>So I volunteered myself for a public service. I extracted the parts of
the discussion that were interesting and relevant into a text
document. I tried to focus on the questions that got interesting
responses. I left out many little asides, and tangential discussions.</p>

<p>The founders of Keybase are malgorithms and maxtaco. Most of the
answers are by them, though in some cases I&rsquo;ve preserved a chain of
replies, with only the first marked as a &ldquo;question&rdquo;. Without further
ado:</p>

<blockquote><h3>General Announcement</h3>

<p>malgorithms 118 days ago</p>

<p>There were multiple questions/comments below about this, so I felt I
should clarify one detail about the keybase client&rsquo;s trust of the
server. When the keybase client requests maria&rsquo;s key from the keybase
server, it does not simply trust the public key because it trusts the
server (or uses https - huh?).</p>

<p>Rather, the server replies with links to tweets, gists, etc. &ndash;
maria&rsquo;s public identity proofs. The keybase client does not trust that
these are honest, so it scrapes them directly and makes sure they were
signed by the same public key that the server provided. In other
words, the server could reply with a different maria, and simply lie,
but not with the real maria&rsquo;s github or twitter account.</p>

<p>The server could also lie by omission, leaving out an identity. But it
cannot invent ones that do not exist, without the client knowing.</p>

<p>Again, the premise here is that maria is the sum of her online
identities.</p>

<p>The website itself is of course a different story. When you look up
maria on keybase&rsquo;s website, you are trusting that keybase.io did not
lie about her github account. Fortunately you can confirm by following
the link to her gist, where she announced her keybase username and
posted her key fingerprint.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>theboss 118 days ago</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t just get the key once, allow you to verify
it, and store it locally. It seems pointless to make all these extra
requests to you.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that gpg does this&hellip;.. Maria&rsquo;s twitter being hacked,
Maria&rsquo;s github being hacked, Maria&rsquo;s Keystore being hacked&hellip;.a lot
can go wrong.</p>

<p>There are still weaknesses like, you lie about a github and link to
your own github, and lie about the public key. And&hellip;many others.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>malgorithms 118 days ago</p>

<p>yes, it does do this; once you&rsquo;re satisfied with maria&rsquo;s identity,
that she&rsquo;s the person you want, you sign a statement to that effect,
which you can store just locally or post back to the server. (or of
course you can just sign her key in GPG!) The latter - posting back to
the server - is for portability reasons. A keybase user will likely
use keybase on multiple machines.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>riquito 117 days ago</p>

<p>The first thing I thought about is a man in the middle attack with
homoglyphs. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m paranoid, but look at this</p>

<blockquote><p>keybase id maria</p></blockquote>

<p>   pgp: C4B3 15B4 7154 5281 5100 1C58 C2A5 977B 0022 github:
   mаria_leah ✓ <a href="https://gist.github.com/23423">https://gist.github.com/23423</a> twitter: mаria_h20 ✓
   <a href="https://t.co/m%D0%B0ria_h20/523554">https://t.co/m%D0%B0ria_h20/523554</a> site: mаriah20.com ✓
   <a href="https://m%D0%B0riah20.com/X904F...">https://m%D0%B0riah20.com/X904F&#8230;</a></p>

<p>I looked up for &lsquo;maria&rsquo;, all ascii. The answer, served by a malicious
server, contains the first &lsquo;a&rsquo; of maria in Cyrillic (check yourself,
you&rsquo;ll see that &lsquo;mаria_leah&rsquo; != &lsquo;maria_leah&rsquo;). This would fool the
user.</p>

<p>Maybe the client should apply some logic as browsers do for IDN
homograph attack to show characters not in your locale in a different
way, or at least warn you.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>malgorithms 117 days ago</p>

<p>Hi riquito - this is a very legitimate concern, and it has to be
reviewed individually for each type of proof keybase supports, in the
client. With twitter, keybase, and github, you can&rsquo;t have a username
containing any character other than an alphanumeric, dash, or
underscore. Which means this kind of attack is impossible.</p>

<p>But for future identity proofs (domains, for example, which we&rsquo;ve yet
to implement), this kind of attack is real. Our approach here will be
that anything outside of normal ascii will be highlighted and
addressed to the user, as a serious warning.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>sweis 118 days ago</p>

<p>Even though there is a disclaimer, I think the &ldquo;encrypt in your
browser&rdquo; feature (<a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">https://keybase.io/encrypt</a>) undermines Keybase&rsquo;s
security credibility.</p>

<p>This form has essentially the same level of security as
Hushmail. Anybody using it should consider the content exposed to
Keybase or anyone compromising Keybase.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an authority on hushmail, but it seems like they do crypto on
the server, and the server is just trusted to throw away the keys and
plaintext?</p>

<p>In the keybase Web client, all crypto happens on the browser. The
server knows no keys or data in plaintext. Of course, you&rsquo;d have to
audit the front-end JS code to believe that claim.</p>

<p>But our intention is that the only way to compromise the Web-based
tools would be to insert malicious JavaScript into the client&rsquo;s
browser. A read-only compromise of the server yields only encrypted
data, and the server never has access to the decryption keys.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>JustARandomGuy 118 days ago</p>

<p>Hi Chris, a few comments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I like the site design, the story flow on the front page does a
great job of explaining what keybase is.</p></li>
<li><p>I see (from the abovementioned story flow) that keys can be
verified by reviewing signed tweets/gists. Is this functionality
extendable to arbitrary links; i.e. verifying keys against personal
blogs, Tumblr, WordPress or does the third-party site need to
implement a recognized API?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Again, thanks so much, and it looks like a terrific site so far.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>malgorithms 118 days ago</p>

<p>Good question! There will be no such thing as a general check, because
&ndash; for any identity &ndash; the client software has to perform a check that
a human would agree means something. For example, what does it mean
that you own a certain blog? How would a person confirm it? Well, at
first glance it might mean that you have the power to post a message
there. But someone else could do that it in a comment, and so that
wouldn&rsquo;t work with Keybase. So any given identity check has to match
some human definition of what it means to have that identity. And it
has to be publicly auditable.</p>

<p>With twitter, it&rsquo;s the ability to post a tweet under a certain
username. With owning a tumblr account, it might be something
similar. With your known StackExchange profile it might mean posting a
statement in a specific part of your profile. And so on.</p>

<p>The common thread in each case is (1) that you post in a place where
only your identity can, and (2) what you post is a signed statement
claiming a connection among three things: (a) your keybase username,
(b) your public key, and (3) the identity on that third party
service. (The third one is necessary so it can&rsquo;t be moved elsewhere.)
Note how twitter and github&rsquo;s are totally different, but achieving
these three things.</p>

<p>We will build out this list of identity checks, hopefully making all
kinds of them easy to do. Everything from proving you own a domain to
having a tumblr or reddit accoun. The definition of those checks will
all be publicly reviewable, both in the spec and in the client, which
is what checks them for you.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>ghayes 118 days ago</p>

<p>Well, to follow up, could this be extended to ownership of a domain
(via DNS txt record)? Could we use this as a means of authentication
of a self-signed certificate for a domain?</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>Yes to DNS, though we have to be careful here since DNS can be spoofed
more easily than github or twitter proofs over https. I was thinking a
slightly better way to prove ownership of foo.com would be to post a
proof at <a href="https://foo.com/_keybase">https://foo.com/_keybase</a> (or something similar). To spoof
this, an attacker would have to spoof DNS and also the https
certificate.</p>

<p>Authenticating a self-signed domain certificate via keybase is a neat
idea, but would probably need some browser support, unless there&rsquo;s a
clever hack that I&rsquo;m not thinking of.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>sneak 118 days ago</p>

<p>I really, really want crypto, specifically, safe and secure-by-default
crypto, to become much more usable.</p>

<p>Despite this hope, I can&rsquo;t seem to help the fact that the first thing
that popped into my head when I read their webpage is &ldquo;oh, they&rsquo;re
wrapping and abstracting important key authentication and critical key
trust configuration to make it more user-friendly, and implementing it
all in javascript. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even if I got whacked on the head one day and suddenly loved
javascript, I would not use it for certain projects when I wanted to
be taken seriously by, say, cryptographers.</p>

<p>Then again, look at all the success cryptocat has had!</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>FiloSottile 118 days ago</p>

<p>As long as the trust model is that the server is untrusted, it can be
written in the language they prefer. As for the client, there can be
as many implementations in as many languages as needed to make
everyone happy IMHO (they call it reference client in the home).</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>sneak 118 days ago</p>

<p>If this talks to keybase&rsquo;s API over https and any large groups come to
rely on this, we&rsquo;ve then effectively replaced the decentralized safety
of the Web of Trust used for authenticating PGP keys with the PKI
that&rsquo;s used in browsers, which is completely and totally fucked.</p>

<p>I cannot support a project that doesn&rsquo;t build and strengthen the
underlying WoT. Getting https involved for authenticating unknown keys
is a huge step backwards. Madness.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not big fans of browser PKI either, but we&rsquo;re using it as
scaffolding that hopefully one day can be torn down.</p>

<p><code>keybase-installer</code> needs an initial install over https from npm. We
unfortunately saw no way around this.</p>

<p>Assuming that install succeeds with integrity, then all future
upgrades of the installer and client are verified with PGP keys stored
locally on the client.</p>

<p>Once the client is installed, it speaks HTTPS to the server, but we&rsquo;re
not trusting the root CA. Rather, we sign with our own CA that we ship
with the client.</p>

<p>The proofs themselves, on twitter and github, all can be verified in
the clear, as FiloSottile points out, but of course relying upon the
HTTPS certificates of twitter and github to make sure the proofs
weren&rsquo;t corrupted in transit between those services and the client.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>bqe 118 days ago</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how using HTTPS for the API has any bearing
whatsoever on the WoT built via PGP.</p>

<p>You can still verify the keys with your client&rsquo;s cached copies, or
using another PGP client.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>FiloSottile 118 days ago</p>

<p>Exactly, and moreover. If there is no trust in the server, everything
can even go over unencrypted HTTP. CAs have no business here.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>IgorPartola 118 days ago</p>

<p>OK, finally looking at it on a desktop&hellip;</p>

<p>So my first question is this: if I know &ldquo;maria&rdquo; and I want to look her
up to get her GPG key, how does keybase handle that? Does it just do
an email address lookup, as in goes to, say, GitHub, grabs her email
address, maria@example.com, then goes to a public key server and grabs
the key that corresponds to maria@example.com?</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, there is a security issue: what if Maria never
published a GPG key, but Chloe did using Maria&rsquo;s email address?
Moreover, what if Chloe has access to Maria&rsquo;s inbox and can read these
messages I believe to be only readable by Maria?</p>

<p>Edit: I see from responses below that various online presences of an
identity tied to &ldquo;maria&rdquo; are checked. Is this not then susceptible to
its own attack? For example, if Maria does not have a Twitter account
and I create one, or compromise hers and post a different key, will I
be able to at least introduce doubt into her identity, if not take it
over outright?</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>No, there are no proofs based on e-mail addresses, because such proofs
are not publicly-auditable. We could ask that maria prove to the
server that she controls a given gmail account, but there&rsquo;s no way for
the server to prove that to you.</p>

<p>We want the server to be untrusted, ideally just a dumb message
router.</p>

<p>If Chloe wants to impersonate maria, she&rsquo;ll need to get control of
maria&rsquo;s twitter and github accounts. Just claiming maria&rsquo;s email
address won&rsquo;t get her anywhere. (Note that GPG keyservers are
susceptible to exactly the attack you describe).</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>IgorPartola 118 days ago</p>

<p>Hold on. First, GPG servers are susceptible to the same type of
attack, except they would never be used that way. You never look up a
person by email, the send them an encrypted message using the key you
get. Instead, you verify their key and email address out of band: you
meet them, check their credentials, then sign the key. Keybase is
trying to get rid of the in-person verification, an effort I applaud,
but in favor of a much weaker check: whether a few centralized
accounts had been compromised.</p>

<p>The other part, where you check Maria&rsquo;s Twitter and GitHub accounts,
means that a few things like Twitter, and GitHub are impervious to
Chloe: a tall order and a centralized one at that.</p>

<p>Once again, is the point here for me to get a tuple of (email address,
public GPG key) so I can email Maria securely? If so, then someone
somewhere has to prove that this tuple fetched from the public key
servers is valid.</p>

<p>If the point is to only communicate via keybase.io, then the service
is centralized, and useless once actual sensitive info is exchanged,
the US government takes notice and shuts it down at the DNS level.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>Cool, I agree no one should use PGP servers the way I described, but
you never know what people are doing out there. To do things the
proper way, as you described, is difficult in practice for lots of
people.</p>

<p>To answer the question, the point isn&rsquo;t to get an (email address,
GPG-key) mapping. It&rsquo;s to get a (public-internet-identity, GPG-key)
mapping. People sometimes do this today in an adhoc manner
(e.g. tweeting your GPG fingerprint). We want it to be checkable by
user-friendly software.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>IgorPartola 118 days ago</p>

<p>I see. That MO makes a bit more sense then, though is it not then
limited to just Keybase.io and will no longer work if something
happens to this service? Or more importantly, is there a way to make
this distributed?</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>If the site went away tomorrow, you&rsquo;d still have keys in your GPG
keychain. You&rsquo;d also have a local cache of the server-side data
relevant to you.</p>

<p>All public server-side data is available as a dump
(<a href="https://keybase.io/__/api-docs/1.0#call-dump-all">https://keybase.io/__/api-docs/1.0#call-dump-all</a>). Private data like
encrypted public keys and password hashes we of course will keep under
wraps.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have immediate plans to make the system distributed, but if
someone did it, we&rsquo;d find it very cool. It&rsquo;s just too much for us to
do right now.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>theboss 118 days ago</p>

<p>Where are the security details published? I think that&rsquo;s what we all
want to see&hellip;</p>

<p>On top of this&hellip;.I think this is cool in theory but bad in practice.</p>

<p>The assumption that Root CA&rsquo;s are trustworthy is already hard enough
to make, how do I know that Maria is actually Maria? How will you
verify that &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; actually owns that twitter, github, gmail. Maybe
it is possible to devise some type of scheme for those sites, but how
about more obscure services?</p>

<p>One mistake in one single account causes the entire thing to fall
apart&hellip;</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>As Chris said, we would like to publish everything, just haven&rsquo;t found
the time yet. We have bits and pieces in wikis in our various github
repositories (almost all of which are open source and public).</p>

<p>The high bits are: all crypto is with GPG/RSA as per RFC4880. There
are of course problems here, but we wanted backwards-compatibility and
well-tested, well-used clients.</p>

<p>We encrypt server-stored GPG private keys (if you choose to use that
option) with TripleSec (see <a href="https://keybase.io/triplesec">https://keybase.io/triplesec</a>).</p>

<p>Users use GPG to sign a series of JSON objects, of the form &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
maxtaco on twitter&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I checked Chris&rsquo;s proofs as of 2014/2/14 and
they look good to me.&rdquo; All JSON objects that a user signs are chained
together with SHA-2 hashes. So a user can sign the whole group of JSON
statements by just signing the most recent one.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example (click on &ldquo;Show the Proof&rdquo;)
<a href="https://keybase.io/max/sigs/ZnBizHMA8RKSB598TaDtjlPlLKSEu1Wu...">https://keybase.io/max/sigs/ZnBizHMA8RKSB598TaDtjlPlLKSEu1Wu&#8230;</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount of engineering that went into the software
distribution system. We rely first on npm to get the initial client
out there, but after that, exclusively GPG for code-signing. That&rsquo;s

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>The idea here isn&rsquo;t that you use keybase to find out Maria&rsquo;s twitter,
github or gmail identities - it&rsquo;s the opposite. The idea is that you
already know who Maria is on one or more of those services, so the
fact that the account you know is Maria&rsquo;s at github has posted a
signed message from that public key is supposed to testify to you that
that is really your Maria&rsquo;s public key.</p>

<p>You could of course manually review and verify Maria&rsquo;s github post
that contains her public key - all that keybase is really doing here
is providing an easy way of discovering that github post (or tweet, or
whatever).</p>

<p>Only if you don&rsquo;t trust your copy of the keybase client (as opposed to
the server, which you should not need to trust).</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>theboss 118 days ago</p>

<p>When I get someone&rsquo;s GPG key I can call them on the telephone or go to
their house and make sure I got the right one.</p>

<p>I add it and use it. When you use this, I&rsquo;m assuming I get that key
every time from the server. I can get it and verify it once, or twice,
or three times, but what about the 1000th time? What happens when I am
important enough that they return a public key that is not Maria&rsquo;s,
and I am none the wiser.</p>

<p>malgorithms 117 days ago</p>

<p>boss, I&rsquo;m glad you answered this question. Because it explains the
impetus for Keybase.</p>

<p>I think what Keybase is addressing in the status quo is twofold: (1)
sadly, almost no one does what you describe; in person meeting key
exchanges and webs of trust may sadly be as unpopular in 20 years as
they are now, and as they were 20 years ago. People who go to them are
often confused, even programmers. I wish it were different.</p>

<p>And (2) more important, in 2014, often the person you&rsquo;re dealing with
is someone whose digital public identity is what matters, not their
face in real life or phone number. If you know me online as
github/malgorithms and twitter/malgorithms, to get my key, meeting
someone in person or talking on the phone to someone who claims to be
me is actually less compelling than a signed statement by malgorithms
in all those places you know me.</p>

<p>And if you do know me in real life, then I can tell you my keybase
username and fingerprint, exactly as you&rsquo;re used to. So it&rsquo;s still as
powerful for meeting in person. With the added benefit you can confirm
my other identities, which you likely know to.</p>

<p>In answer to your scenario about verifying: you only need to review
the &ldquo;maria&rdquo; the server provides once, and then your private key signs
a full summary of maria &ndash; her key and proofs. Cases 2 through 1000 of
performing a crypto action on maria involve you only trusting your own
signature of what &ldquo;maria&rdquo; is. The client can query the server for
changes to her identity, and this will be configurable; if maria adds
a new proof, you might wish to know.</p>

<p>This is what I assumed the answer would be, and at this point it just
becomes a difference in opinion. I personally do not believe that the
methods you describe are generally acceptable options in the modern
age. My phone number and address are much more important to me than
the off chance of someone capturing my https traffic, breaking it, and
inserting a fake public key. There is a point where the absolute
security of exchanging public keys written on pieces of paper in a
park are called for, but it&rsquo;s not for everyone or even most.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>jonesetc 118 days ago</p>

<p>Is there a way to remove an associated account?</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>maxtaco 118 days ago</p>

<p>Yes, though it might be broken right now. Our plan is to allow this,
for sure.</p>

<h3>Q:</h3>

<p>diasp 117 days ago</p>

<p>Interesting. Another approach is <a href="https://encrypt.to/">https://encrypt.to/</a> which loads the
public key from key servers and encrypts client-side via JS.</p>

<h3>A:</h3>

<p>malgorithms 117 days ago</p>

<p>To clarify the difference, it seems encrypt.to is a service which does
PGP crypto in the browser, based on keys pulled from keyservers. In
contrast, Keybase is an identity-proving service, which proves key X
belongs to person with twitter account Y, github account Z, etc. As a
convenience, it also does encryption and other crypto actions for its
users.</p></blockquote>
