<div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="/blog/2014/10/07/dot-dot-dot-and-this-is-why-master-should-be-stable/">Why Master Should Be Stable</a>. I
spent most of that post explaining what had actually happened to me,
but not really talking about the fundamental underlying difficulty.
Well, now that I&rsquo;ve encountered this issue again in a different
context, maybe it&rsquo;s time to dive in a bit and examine what I call the
Doc&rsquo;s Mismatch problem, and how it can be avoided.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As the title hints, this issue is really more about being able to
match the documentation of a project to a particular version. The
problem with Flaskr was that when you went searching for the
documentation, you most easily found the documentation for the
currently in development branch. This isn&rsquo;t a problem when no major
changes have been made, but when there are major changes this becomes
an issue.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that I&rsquo;m writing this blog post is because last
week, while I was going through the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> project&rsquo;s <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> I ran
into the exact same issue! But I didn&rsquo;t spot that this version
mismatch was the issue until after I had found another workaround.</p>

<p>Not to belabor the point, but basically the LLVM tutorial linked above
is actually the version of the tutorial written for the upcoming 3.6
release. Since there are several breaking changes to the API occurring
in this release, when you have installed LLVM 3.5 the tutorial appears
to be rather broken.</p>

<p>This problem is sort of ironic as the majority of open source software
out there (most definitely including all of my projects :) as
little-to-no documentation, and/or what there is, is hopelessly
out-of-date. In contrast, the issue that I had with both Flaskr and
LLVM was actually a case of the most easily available documentation
being TOO up-to-date.</p>

<h3>How can we do better?</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s contrast these experiences with a project that gets it right:
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. First off, I just want to praise the Django project for
their excellent documentation in general. There is a lot of it, and it
is fairly well-written and clear. There is also a good mixture of the
<a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/">three types of documentation</a> that every project
needs.<code>&lt;/praise&gt;</code></p>

<p>Okay, now lets look at how Django avoids the Docs Mismatch
problem. First, look at the URL for the main
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/">Django Documentation page</a>:
<code>https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/</code>.  Notice that <code>1.7</code> at the
end? That indicates what version of Django these docs are for. At the
time of this writing, 1.7 is the latest <strong>stable</strong> release of
Django. So, right away Django is doing well. By default the link on
the Django homepage takes you to this page.  And you can bet, that
when the next stable release of Django comes out, that homepage will
be updated to point at the 1.8 version.</p>

<p>However, there is still more that Django is getting fundamentally
right here. By embedding the version of the documentation in the URL,
they can host multiple different versions of the documentation. And
they do! This means that if you&rsquo;re forced to use an older version of
Django for whatever reason (legacy project, no install privileges
etc.) you can still go online to the Django website and find the
documentation for the version you&rsquo;re using. To make this even easier,
their documentation pages all have a permanent float in the bottom
right hand corner that shows the current version of the docs that
you&rsquo;re looking at, and has links to other recent versions of the
documentation.  How cool is that!</p>

<p>If you look at the links in that little floated element, you&rsquo;ll notice
a non-numbered version is available <code>dev</code>. This is the documentation
for the [current development head][djangodevdoc]. More importantly,
notice that this is the equivalent of the documentation that was
easiest for me to find when dealing with both LLVM and Flaskr. But
with Django I had to specifically go looking for it. Why? Because most
people don&rsquo;t want to read the docs for the development head.  And if
they do, they know it!</p>

<p>Django gets one more thing really right here. When you go to the dev
docs page, they automatically add a float at the top of the screen, in
an eye-catching color that effectively says: &ldquo;These are the dev
docs. Are you sure you want to be reading them? They&rsquo;re probably
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last feature is really the key to avoiding the Docs Mismatch
problem. The development docs are fairly rarely what people want to be
reading when they first pick up a new project. So they shouldn&rsquo;t be
the easiest (or only!) documentation to find for your project.</p>

<h3>How do we fix it?</h3>

<p>The ideal situation is for your documentation to be structured like
Django&rsquo;s: multiple versions available, notifications when viewing the
dev version. The good news is that this is much easier to achieve
thany you might expect. <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read The Docs</a> makes it trivial to have this
kind of setup for your open source project. In fact, Django actually
uses Read The Docs for their own documentation. I highly recommend
checking out their page and seeing just how easy it is to set up for
your own projects. Of course, once you have this awesome system the
only issue is actually writing all the awesome documentation to
populate it&hellip;</p>

<h3>Other issues</h3>

<p>A primary problem with the Docs Mismatch issue is that the people who
notice it are typically people just wanting to use the project, not
the people developing it. This is especially problematic because these
people are also the most easily discouraged from using a project.</p>

<p>Another problem is that often - especially in older projects - fixing
the Docs Mismatch issue will require either access to a server, or
changes in a release deployment process or something similar. None of
these things are possible for a beginner in a project to do. This
means that the people the most motivated to fix the issue, are the
least able to do anything about it.</p>
